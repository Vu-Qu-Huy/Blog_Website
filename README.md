## User Walkthrough

### Homepage Overview
   - The main screen displays the homepage, which details the various features of the website: comments, likes, tags, a search bar, and the requirement to log in for certain actions. The navbar includes links to "About" (which shows other users' posts), "Blog" (which shows your posts), a dropdown "Posts" for creating new blogs, and a "Login or Signup" button. Posts can be viewed and searched without logging in, but creating a new blog, liking, and commenting require a user account.
